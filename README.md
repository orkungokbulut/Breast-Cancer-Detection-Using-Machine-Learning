# Breast-Cancer-Detection-Using-Python-Machine-Learning
This study presents the performance results of the classification algorithms used in the literature using breast cancer data. In this context, KNN, Naive Bayes, Decision Tree, Logistic Regression, Artificial Neural Network, Support Vector Machine and Random Forest algorithms were applied to the data set. In order to examine the model performance from another perspective, the performance of the models was re-evaluated by applying PCA (Principal Component Analysis) to the data. The applied algorithms and accuracy performance percentages are shown in Table below.
