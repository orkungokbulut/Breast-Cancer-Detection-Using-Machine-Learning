# Breast-Cancer-Detection-Using-Python-Machine-Learning
This study evaluates the performance results of the classification algorithms over Wisconsin breast cancer dataset. 
In this context 7 algorithms used;

KNN
Naive Bayes
Decision Tree
Logistic Regression
Artificial Neural Network
Support Vector Machine
Random Forest Classifier

In order to examine the model performance from another perspective, the performance of the models was re-evaluated by applying PCA (Principal Component Analysis) to the data. 
The applied algorithms and accuracy performance percentages are shown by the Tables on the code.

In evaluations, it was seen that the Random Forest and Support Vector Machine algorithms have the highest performance rate with an accuracy of 96%. 
The performance of these algorithms may vary due to the features and application methods in the data set used.
